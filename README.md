Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's designed for anyone interested in creating interactive projects, from beginners to experienced engineers. The core of the platform is the Arduino board, a microcontroller that can be programmed to sense and control physical objects like lights, motors, and sensors.

Arduino uses its own integrated development environment (IDE) and a simplified version of C/C++ to write code, making it accessible for those new to programming and electronics. The platform has a large, supportive community and a vast ecosystem of components, shields, and libraries, making it ideal for prototyping and learning about embedded systems, robotics, IoT, and creative coding.
